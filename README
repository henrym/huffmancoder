HuffmanCoder - a small python demonstration of Huffman coding.

Usage:
$ python
>>> import huffmancoder as h
>>> t = h.HuffmanTree('hello world')
>>> s = t.encode()
>>> s
'01100110101100000101101110101111'
>>> t.decode(s)
'hello world'


The longer-term goals are to have something feasible set up for using huffman
coding to 'compress' some text for transfer over a network.

With the sending end using the full text to:

 1. create a huffman tree;
 2. encode the text; and
 3. compress/encode the tree

before transferring the tree and text to the receiving end, which will:

 1. decode the tree; then
 2. use the decoded tree to decode the text for full reproduction on the other
    side.
